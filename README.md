# Geology Research
The following is a collection of scripts used while conducting research under Dr.
Andrew Hawkins. We are trying to find the bias -- if any -- of the dissolution of
calcite and aragonite species.

week of 4/1
1. create a Nx1 matrix where each row corresponds to a collecting locality and
the value is equal to 1+number of redundant sites
redundant sites are those that have the same calcitic taxa present

2. plot Nx1 matrix

week of 4/7
iterate through all sites
if site redundant then randomly assign it a taxon (bivalve, brachipod, gastropod)

week of 4/11
count number of other sites within distance for each site/occurrence
average this value among all other occurrences
list the sites that bivalves occur
list the sites that gasts occur
list the sites that brachs occur
add up number of sites in each taxa and average the value among all three
