# Geology Research
The following is a collection of scripts used while conducting research under Dr.
Andrew Hawkins. We are trying to find the bias -- if any -- of the dissolution of
calcite and aragonite species.

week of 4/1
1. create a Nx1 matrix where each row corresponds to a collecting locality and
the value is equal to 1+number of redundant sites
redundant sites are those that have the same calcitic taxa present

2. plot Nx1 matrix

week of 4/7
iterate through all sites
if site redundant then randomly assign it a taxon (bivalve, brachipod, gastropod)
