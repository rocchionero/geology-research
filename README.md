# Geology Research
The following is a collection of scripts used while conducting research under Dr.
Andrew Hawkins. We are trying to find the bias -- if any -- of the dissolution of
calcite and aragonite species.

create a Nx1 matrix where each row corresponds to a collecting locality and
the value is equal to 1+number of redundant sites
redundant sites are those that have the same calcitic taxa present
